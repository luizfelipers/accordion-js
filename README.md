# accordion-js
Accordion component to be used with images as a sort of gallery

This was one of my first attempts to translate pure html, css and Javascript, into React Components, so I didn't modularize it as much as I should, but it was a good step towards understanding Componentization.
I decided to keep the CSS file, instead of creating Styled Components at the time, but would be a nice addition to refactor it in the future.
When mouse hovers one item, this Item expands in a smooth way, capturing reader's focus and attention.

--This project was bootstrapped with Facebook's Create-React-App.
